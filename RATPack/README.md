The RAT Pack provides Ram Air Turbines that provide power from flowing air. I was partly inspired by a documentary on the "Gimli Glider", a 767 that had to glide to a landing with nothing but batteries and a RAT to power critical systems. A couple of spaceplane landings where I had to constantly manage electric charge to maintain control and keep enough for the landing gave me some incentive to actually build it. The RATs are designed to provide emergency power and have peak power at or slightly above that of an RTG. Electric charge output is a function of both airspeed and atmospheric density.

# The RAT Pack:


- RAT-1 "Pinwheel" Ram Air Turbine – As basic as they come, it provides little power and must be activated manually.


- RAT-360 "Cage Master" Ram Air Turbine – Generates more power and will automatically start up when electric charge is depleted.


- RAT-6000 "Pack Master" Ram Air Turbine – The most powerful RAT. This one has the ability to control electric charge flowing from its internal battery and turns it on only when it is activating. It is able to generate peak power over a broader range.

# Questions and Answers:

Q: Are these realistic?

A: Probably not. RATs really do exist and they do have these basic capabilities, but I just tried to make the operating envelope useful and fun, I have no idea what it should be. They probably should not survive the speeds or temperatures they are allowed to.

Q: Where can I use them?

A: Anywhere with an atmosphere. Kerbin, Duna, Eve, Laythe are all good places to use them. Jool and Kerbol might work, but you'll probably be crushed or melted before you get any power.

Q: What happens if I run out of power landing on the Mun with a RAT?

A: You will probaby hit the Mun and the RAT will be destroyed. You need an atmosphere.

Q: What happens if I run out of power landing at the KSC with a RAT?

A: If you have an auto-activating RAT it will deploy and start generating power. If it is a manual RAT, you can't activate it after losing power, so prepare for high speed lithobraking.

Q: Do they work inside fairings or cargo bays?

A: No, they need to be in the air-stream.

Q: How does orientation affect RATs?

A: Right now it doesn't, though that may change in the future.

This mod is in beta and not considered complete enough for a full release. In particular the textures are very basic and in need of improvement. I think the tech tree placement is OK, but I would appreciate some feedback. The models/animations could use more polish, but are roughly where I want them. The plugin is pretty much production ready, though I'm seriously considering adding some consequences to activating a RAT such as increased drag.
