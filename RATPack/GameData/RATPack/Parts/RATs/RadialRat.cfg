	description = A Ram Air Turbine with the ability to auto-activate when power is lost. Providing more power than earlier models you can almost power a coffee maker or SAS (sold separately). Built inside of an aerodynamic shell it takes a few seconds to deploy and provide power. Due to the aerodynamic shell it requires higher speeds and/or pressures to generate power, but isn't subject to power drop off above mach 1.
