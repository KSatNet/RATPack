	description = A highly advanced Ram Air Turbine. Supposedly created after one of the engineers was introduced to oragami, it folds up to conserve space. It deploys automatically when when a power loss is detected. It contains an internal battery that automatically enables to provide power while it deploys, ensuring near continous power.
